Description: Constructs paths to your project's files.  The
    'here()' function uses a reasonable heuristics to find your project's
    files, based on the current working directory at the time when the
    package is loaded. Use it as a drop-in replacement for 'file.path()',
    it will always locate the files relative to your project root.
